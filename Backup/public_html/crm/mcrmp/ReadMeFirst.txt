*********************************** Important **************************

While installing, if you get an error that says "500 Whoops, something went wrong on our servers", 
it's probably because you have incorrect version of PHP installed or any required PHP extension is 
missing on your server. So please check that and take action accordingly. 

However in case you you have correct PHP version installed including all the required PHP extensions, 
then please go to the location on your server where you uploaded all the files, find a file called .env and 
open it (in case you can't see it turn on viewing the hidden files from your cpanel settings option) . 
Now look for the following

APP_ENV=
APP_DEBUG = 

Change the values so that they look like following

APP_ENV=development 
APP_DEBUG=true
 

Now go to your browser and start installing the app from the very begining and this time instead of the 
above error page, you should see a different page. Please take a screenshot of it and then send us at 
support@microelephant.io with detail information about the problem and your purchase code. In order
to get your problem quickly fixed, please make sure to send us a login credential to your cpanel.

Thanks
